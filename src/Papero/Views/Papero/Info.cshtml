                PREAMBLE<br />
                The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br />
                development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br />
                efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br />
                open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br />
                with others.<br />
                <br />
                The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br />
                redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br />
                fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br />
                redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />
                names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />
                however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />
                requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />
                to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br />
                <br />
